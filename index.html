            I studied biochemistry and engineering management in college and worked as an operations manager for
            5 years before teaching myself to code. My goal is to be able to deliver complete web applications on
            Linux systems, so my interests lie in everything from devops automation to application code and
            producing a functional UI, although I’m definitely not a designer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest motivator is to always be becoming something new, better, or at the very least, different,
            in the hope of always challenging myself to see things in new ways. I'm at my best when I know what
            needs to be done and I know that the only thing in between me and a big goal is a lot of work, but I
            learn the most about myself when I have no idea what needs to be done and I know that only thing in
            between me and figuring that out is a period of focused quiet. Balancing those periods of intense
            action and equally intense quiet in a business environment is my greatest (business) strength, and
            building that discipline within a team is my value.
          </p>

            If you're looking for a more traditional, keyword-loaded resume, then head on over to my LinkedIn
            page. But if you're tired of reading bulletpoint after bulletpoint of business-speak and
            personal-brand-building, then read on. My goal here is to communicate what each of my experiences
            actually means to me and what I hope they mean to those who work with me. Hopefully it's a good
            read and worth your time!

              My current role is heavy in Docker, Mongo and Ruby. Previous professional experience
              was heavy in Meteor, CoffeeScript, Bootstrap and Less. During my self-learning period,
              I primarily used Python and Django to learn web development. Personal projects have
              dabbled in ES6 JavaScript, Express and React.

            One of my favorite parts of this career is that there is always plenty to learn. Beyond continuing to
            develop the skills and capabilities mentioned above, here are a few technologies I'd like to work with
            in the future, and a few things I'd like to do with them:

          </ul>

          <p>
            Go is the number one new technology that I'd like to learn in the next year or two.
            I've always worked in interpreted, dynamically typed languages, but I've played around with just enough Go and
            I've been in contact with just enough Java to have an idea of how a statically typed language could both improve
            my programs and challenge me to think about problems in a new way. I'm always on the lookout for small Go
            tools that I could build and distribute in my current devops role, and it would be interesting to see how
            TypeScript changes the approach to front end development after having worked with JavaScript in my first job.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first professional role was as a full stack developer, and in that time I did my fair share of HTML and CSS work.
            But I know that HTML5 and CSS3 have introduced some really cool features that I'm not familiar with, and it would
            be interesting to learn more about what can be done in a modern browser. Having done just enough at-home React
            learning to know that I think it's an awesome idea, I'd also love the opportunity to see what front end programming
            is like in a professional, full-scale React applicatoin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I got my web development start shipping micro-scale Heroku apps. While my current role involves a lot
            of devops heavy lifting on internal servers and platforms, my small business mind can't stop wondering just how
            much I could get done on a platform like Heroku now that I know a lot more about what I'm doing. Heroku's integration
            with Travis would make for an interesting project to see how far a one man show can take things on today's web.
          </p>

            Outside of work I'm an avid runner and reader, and occasional pianist. I spent about four years training for
            long course triathlons and loved every minute, but after making it all the way to the Ironman finish line in 2016
            I've been spending far more time reading books learning about how people see the world in different ways. I'm
            loving my new, slightly more relaxed lifestlye, and am feeding the competitive spirit with some new goals of running
            fast instead of far.

                I had been exploring career changes for about 2 years before I left Wasatch, so this move was well-considered
                in some ways and spontaneous in others. I just got to a point where I knew I wanted to work in a more
                technical role, and a small company like Wasatch simply did not provide the opportunties that I needed.
                I tried to make a smooth, gap-less transition, but sometimes you reach a point where you just have to take
                a leap of faith and that's what I did.
              </p>
              <p>
                My plan was to move closer to family in Greenville, SC and try to find an operations position in either
                the BMW or GE economies in the area, thus transitioning to a more promising operations career than Wasatch
                could provide. But for my first month off, I made a deal with myself that I could do whatever I wanted as
                long as I was working on <i>something</i>. I wound up spending every day studying web development, and I
                loved it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I never found a job in the BMW/GE economies, but by July I had made so much progress in my web development
                learning that I began to think a new programming career was not only realistic but actually a better place
                to focus my energy. So I went all in, and began to only apply for junior web development positions. In
                August I found Practichem, and my bet paid off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between making an all-in bet on my professional career and training for my first Ironman, this period
                was one of if not the most rewarding of my life. I learned to trust my instincts and my unique abilities
                and to respect my desire for a more fulfilling life. I learned what I'm capable of doing when I commit
                to something, and refuse to be distracted or stop until I get where I'm going. And I learned that big,
                unimaginable goals like new careers and Ironman finish lines are often much closer than they appear,
                and all you have to do is make a little progress one day at a time, and eventually you'll find yourself
                in a better place.

              <p>
                As I continued to build my role as the operations manager, I lead division-wide operational improvements in internal
                communication, project management, manufacturing processes, documentation and record keeping systems, and purchasing activities.
                I did this by developing a system that was optimized for primarily project-based work, minimizing the need for central
                control to maximize flexibility and responsiveness.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important thing I learned in this role was how to work with different personalities and how to lead them
                into a common vision. You can't just tell people what to do, and different people respond to different leadership
                approaches. To move a team in a common direction, you have to get to know people and respect them for who they are.

                This was my first job out of college where I was primarily responsbile for managing our component and
                finished goods inventory and maintaining the associated accounting systems. In the process I built
                relationships with some key suppliers, and lay the foundations of my becoming an effective Director of
                Operations.
              </p>
              <p>But the project that stands out from all of the others is the time we didn't have enough
                money in the budget for a team of lawyers, so I spent a month or two teaching myself the ins and outs
                of ITAR law (the export laws that got Reagan in trouble) and managed to get a favorable classification
                from the State Department, with my arguments approved by the lawyers I was given $1,000 to work with.

                I mention this internship because in many ways it set the tone for my entire career to date. The role
                was completely open-ended in that I was tasked with finding a way to make the lab better with zero
                direction as to how I should do that. I wound up teaching myself how to write Excel VBA scripts, and
                used that to implement an automated data analysis program for one of the lab technicians. It was the
                first time I combined something I knew (biochemistry) with something I taught myself (VBA), to do
                something nobody told me to do.

                The most important course I took at Duke was Management of High-Tech Industries in which we constantly
                talked about the differences between management and leadership. I actually made a B in that class
                because I was never much for volunteering my thoughts to a class of 60, but the lessons learned have
                served me well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond that course, Duke was my first experience in seeing the world in a very different
                way, as the whole experience of graduate school in a non-technical program among a new student body stood
                in stark contrast to my time at Tech.

                The most important thing I learned at Georgia Tech was how quickly a person can become something
                completely new if they have the resources to do it and they put the work in. In four short years
                I learned more about biochemistry&mdash;everything from quantitative methods to enzyme mechanisms
                to DNA transcription and translation to cell signaling pathways and systemic responses&mdash;than
                I ever would have though possible going in. I don't use any of that anymore (although I do secretly
                hope to end up in another biotech company someday), but it constantly reminds me that with the right
                resources and a lot of hard work, a person can become something completely new in a few short years.
